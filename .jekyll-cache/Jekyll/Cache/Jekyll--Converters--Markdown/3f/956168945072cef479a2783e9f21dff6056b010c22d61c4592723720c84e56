Today we will see how to create a simple DevOps project.
Here we will use a JAVA development project for DevOps system building purposes, cicd with jenkins.
What is DevOps?. Let's see a real time scenario. Where do we need DevOps?. Let's say you are working on a JAVA project.
We have 3 servers. Development dev, test - UAT (User Acceptance Testing) and product - Production server.
Many developers work on the project. The developers will push their code to the development server.
If everything is fine, then the code is passed to the UAT server. If the UAT passes the test, then the code is moved to the final production server.
All steps are done manually only. Every time we have to manually move the code from one server to another with dependent libraries manually.
Everything is a manual process. It will take more time.
DevOps is a process and it includes many tools to automate the process and it is used to ease the work of developer and operations team.
