  <h4>
    The fastest way is to connect to the IRC on webchat and join #nulldoot and ask in there. Someone can usually point you in the right direction.
    For general questions about using IRC click HERE. If your question is unanswered, try the #help channel and inquire there. Most of the admins monitor that channel.
    If all those steps fail, type !staff in #nulldoot PM one of the staff members online. The network admins are usually quite busy so do this LAST not first.
